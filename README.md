# 🔗 Word Ladder Puzzle Solver

A Python-based solution to the classic **Word Ladder** problem, which finds the shortest transformation sequence from a start word to an end word, changing only one letter at a time with each intermediate word being valid.

## 📌 Features

- Solves word ladder puzzles using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**.
- Validates words using a dictionary or word list.
- Finds the **shortest transformation path** between two words.
- Easily extendable for different word lengths or dictionaries.

## 🧠 Problem Definition

Given:
- A start word
- A target end word
- A dictionary of valid words

Find the shortest transformation sequence such that:
- Only one letter changes at each step
- Every intermediate word exists in the dictionary

Example:

Input: start = "hit" end = "cog" dict = ["hot", "dot", "dog", "lot", "log", "cog"]

Output: ["hit", "hot", "dot", "dog", "cog"]

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- A word list file (`words.txt`) or use the built-in one if provided.

### How to Run

```bash
python word_ladder_solver.py

Sample Command Line Arguments (if implemented):

python word_ladder_solver.py hit cog words.txt
